Restaurant Revenue Prediction

This method uses a machine learning model in Python to estimate hotel revenue based on a variety of criteria; the Restaurant Revenue dataset from Kaggle will be used.

This code was generated based on other scripts, and I adjusted the dataset and code to meet my requirements. This is my online internship assignment. My models were XGB Regressor ML.
